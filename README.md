We use [MiBench](https://github.com/embecosm/mibench) as our benchmark.

To run the pass, first make sure you are in the `combined` directory.

1. Create a build folder and run `cmake ..` inside it.

2. Run `sh makeandrun.sh` to test if the pass works.

3. *benchmarks/dot* folder contains cfg outputs.
